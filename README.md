- 👋 Hi, I’m Nikos (Nicholas) Christakis, a physicist by education and a computational scientist by elaboration
- 👀 I’m interested in all things numerical that involve the modelling of physical systems, with a particular interest in Machine Learning, Numerical Meteorology and Fluid Dynamics
- 🌱 I’m always trying to keep up with new developments in the fields of physics/mathematics/computational science 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting ideas where Machine Learning gets entangled with Physics.  Or, on any project really that turns creativity into currency!
- 📫 How to reach me: nchrkis@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: The octopus, despite being relatively small compared to humans, has a brain-to-body mass ratio rivaling that of some mammals and is one of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. What’s even more fascinating is that about two-thirds of its neurons are in its arms, meaning its limbs can solve problems and even "think" independently of its central brain.  Moral: True cleverness doesn’t come from centralized control—it comes from empowering all parts of the system to think and act independently!
